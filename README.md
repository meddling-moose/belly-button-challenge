# belly-button-challenge

As always my data comes from the university instructors.

This assignment forced me to learn how to write javaScript more confidently. The D3 and Plotly libraries were very useful in selecting the html elements I wanted to manipulate and graph the per subject data. I also had brief practice with mapping and filtering functions. These felt really nimble and concise which was fun.

One thing I didn't get a chance to fully flesh out was manipulating the sizes of my bubbles in the bubble plot. I wanted the final result to be a little smaller, but they are overlapping one another in some of the subjects graphs.
